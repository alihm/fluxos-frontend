# Enable Google Analytics in production
# IMPORTANT: Set to 'true' only when deploying to production
#
# This provides a safety layer - analytics only runs if BOTH conditions are met:
# 1. Production build (npm run build)
# 2. VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
#
# Set to 'false' for:
# - Staging environments
# - Testing production builds locally
# - Temporarily disabling analytics
#
# Note: Users must still consent via the cookie banner before tracking begins.
#       This setting only controls whether analytics is available to be enabled.
